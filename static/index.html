	<p>My name is Ryan Chavez and I am a ux designer and researcher.</p>
	<p>I am a student at the University of California, San Diego studying Human-Computer Interaction. I have spent time working for design firms, non-profits and programs. I design interfaces and interactions, evaluate usability, determine needs, apply art and science, gather data, and gather more data; all with the user at the center.</p>
